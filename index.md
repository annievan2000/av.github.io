## About Me
![Portrait of me](/me.png)

I am a 3rd year undergraduate at UCSD majoring in **Computer Science** and minoring in **Business**. I am interested in *Software Engineering and Product Management* roles. I enjoy working with people to bring a vision to life. In the future, I hope to build ethical algorithms in the tech industry and innovate accessible tools for people to use around the world. 

## About the Code
Wise Words:
> Start early, start often.

This is a ~~simple~~ ***totally amazing*** snippet of code to in my favorite programming language, C++.
``` c
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "enjoys baking, watching Youtube videos, and traveling";
    if(angry){
        cout <<"please feed";
    }
    return to_the_nearest_trendy_coffee_shop;
    
}
```
